        Hi! I am Clement, a junior frontend developer from Nice , France. <br />
        This is my Portfolio, which I use to showcase everything I develop. I
        specialize in React.js development with TypeScript with a intuitive
        design and attention to details. Why you might ask ? <br />
        Well, scroll down and let me convince you.
